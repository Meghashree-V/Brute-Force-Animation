## Brute-Force String Matching Visualization

This project visualizes the Brute-Force (Naive) String Matching algorithm. Enter a text and a pattern, and see how the algorithm attempts to find the pattern within the text, step by step.

### How it works
- **Text**: The main string in which you want to search for a pattern.
- **Pattern**: The substring you want to find within the text.
- Click **Start** to see the algorithm compare the pattern at every position in the text.
- The visualization shows each comparison, highlighting matches and mismatches.

## Screenshots

### Example 1: Pattern 'sh' in 'meghashree'

*The algorithm aligns the pattern 'sh' under the text and shows the comparison. Matching and non-matching characters are color-coded for clarity.*

### Example 2: Pattern 'sh' in 'meghashree' (Match Highlighted)

*Here, the visualization highlights the successful match of the pattern 'sh' within the text 'meghashree'.*

### Example 3: Pattern 'hr' in 'Meghashree'

*This screenshot demonstrates the search for the pattern 'hr' in 'Meghashree'. The visualization shows the alignment and comparison of characters, with color coding for matches and mismatches.*

## Usage
1. Enter your desired text and pattern in the input fields.
2. Click **Start** to visualize the brute-force matching process.
3. Observe how the algorithm slides the pattern over the text and checks for matches.
